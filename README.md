# HoneyPot-SIEM-Lab

## Part 1. Setup Azure Subscription

Create Free Azure Subscription: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

If Azure doesn‚Äôt let you create a free account, you can either
1.	Create a paid subscription and be mindful of shutting down/deleting your resources when you are done, or

After your subscription is created, you can login at:
https://portal.azure.com


## Part 2. Create the Honey Pot (Azure Virtual Machine)

Go to: https://portal.azure.com and search for virtual machines

Create a new Windows 10 virtual machine. Remember the username and password

Go to the Network Security Group for your virtual machine and create a rule that allows all traffic inbound

Log into your virtual machine and turn off the windows firewall (start -> wf.msc -> properties -> all off)


## Part 3. Logging into the VM and inspecting logs

Fail 3 logins as ‚Äúemployee‚Äù (or some other username)

Login to your virtual machine

Open up Event Viewer and inspect the security logs

See the 3 failed logins as ‚Äúemployee‚Äù, event ID 4625

Next, we are going to create a central log repository called a LAW



## Part 4. Log Forwarding and KQL

Create Log Analytics Workspace

Create a Sentinel Instance and connect it to Log Analytics

(observe architecture)

Configure the ‚ÄúWindows Security Events via AMA‚Äù connector

Create the DCR within sentinel, watch for extension creation

Query for logs within the LAW


We can now query the Log analytics workspace as well as the SIEM, sentinel directly, which we will do soon

Note: Querying logs in here is a really important skill that you MUST have if you want to work in security operations. Depending on where you work, you need to know SQL, KQL, or SPL, but these are all basically the same thing. If you know one, you can easily learn the others.  

Observe some of your VM logs:

SecurityEvent
| where EventId == 4625

(observe architecture)

## Part 5. Log Enrichment and Finding Location Data

Observe the SecurityEvent logs in the Log Analytics Workspace; there is no location data, only IP address, which we can use to derive the location data.

We are going to import a spreadsheet (as a ‚ÄúSentinel Watchlist‚Äù) which contains geographic information for each block of IP addresses.

Download: geoip-summarized.csv

Within Sentinel, create the watchlist:

Name/Alias: geoip
Source type: Local File
Number of lines before row: 0
Search Key: network

Allow the watchlist to fully import, there should be a total of roughly 54,000 rows.

In real life, this location data would come from a live source or it would be updated automatically on the back end by your service provider.

(observe architecture)

Observe the logs now have geographic information, so you can see where the attacks are coming from

let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent
    | where IpAddress == <attacker IP address>
    | where EventID == 4625
    | order by TimeGenerated desc
    | evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network);
WindowsEvents


(observe architecture)

## Part 6. Attack Map Creation

Within Sentinel, create a new Workbook

Delete the prepopulated elements and add a ‚ÄúQuery‚Äù element

Go to the advanced editor tab, and paste the JSON

Workbook (Attack map):
map.json

Observe the query
Observe the map settings






## So to summarize:

üõ†Ô∏è 1. Provision Azure Resources
Set up an Azure Log Analytics workspace as your centralized log repository.

Launch a virtual machine (Windows) and expose it to the internet ‚Äî this will serve as your honeypot to attract attackers. 

üîç 2. Forward Logs to Sentinel
Connect your VM‚Äôs security and system logs to the Sentinel workspace using the Log Analytics agent.

Confirm logs are ingested ‚Äî you'll see them in the Sentinel portal. 


üåê 3. Enrich and Visualize Threats
Use built-in GeoIP enrichment in Sentinel to tag attacker traffic with their geographical origin.

Generate a map visualization to display where connections (or attacks) are coming from. 


üö® 4. Investigate and Query Attacks
Open Sentinel‚Äôs Log Analytics and run Kusto (KQL) queries to identify failed login attempts or suspicious activity.

Use this to build detections and understand attacker behavior. 

üìä 5. Build Dashboards
Create a Sentinel workbook/dashboard showing live attack maps, key metrics (e.g. number of failed logins), and enriched insights.

‚úÖ Final Recap
You end up with a fully functioning SOC lab: VM honeypot, log ingestion, geo-enrichment, analytic queries, and insight dashboards‚Äîall running on a free or trial Azure subscription. Shoutout to Josh Makador for the video tutorial below!
